        "generated": "Attention is a mechanism that involves mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where all these elements are vectors. It is a fundamental concept in the Transformer model, a type of attention-based model, where self-attention is used to relate different positions of a single sequence and compute its representation.\n\nSelf-attention, or intra-attention, can make models more interpretable by providing insights into the attention distributions. The model's attention is sharp for specific words, as demonstrated in the provided knowledge.\n\nThe Transformer model has shown promising results, and there are plans to extend its applications to various input and output modalities beyond text."
